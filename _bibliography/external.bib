  abstract = {Pursuing the notions of ambidexterity and higher semiadditivity as developed by Hopkins and Lurie, we prove that the span {$$\infty$$}-category of $$m$$-finite spaces is the free $$m$$-semiadditive {$$\infty$$}-category generated by a single object. Passing to presentable {$$\infty$$}-categories we obtain a description of the free presentable $$m$$-semiadditive {$$\infty$$}-category in terms of a new notion of $$m$$-commutative monoids, which can be described as spaces in which families of points parameterized by $$m$$-finite spaces can be coherently summed. Such an abstract summation procedure can be used to give a formal {$$\infty$$}-categorical definition of the finite path integral described by Freed, Hopkins, Lurie and Teleman in the context of one-dimensional topological field theories.},
