      abstract={We use Markov categories to develop generalizations of the theory of Markov chains and hidden Markov models in an abstract setting. This comprises characterizations of hidden Markov models in terms of local and global conditional independences as well as existing algorithms for Bayesian filtering and smoothing applicable in all Markov categories with conditionals. We show that these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter, forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother when instantiated in appropriate Markov categories. Under slightly stronger assumptions, we also prove that the sequence of outputs of the Bayes filter is itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps.
There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its generality, as it can be used in any Markov category with conditionals. In particular, it provides a systematic unified account of hidden Markov models and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and others at the same time. The second feature is the intuitive visual representation of information flow in these algorithms in terms of string diagrams.},

The case of Polarized Abelian Varieties is then specialized to. An actual projective embedding is then constructed, and the notes move on to describe a characterization of the ring of abelian functions. The final section is an identification of the Picard group of an abelian variety using Appell-Humbert data.},

This is however, false when we drop the assumption that our spaces and maps are based, or if we drop the assumption that the spaces under consideration are connected. We describe a construction, often called the “Freyd-Heller” group, that results in a counterexample in both cases.},

  abstract={Michael Hopkins and Jacob Lurie introduce for m at most n, a notion of m-semiadditivity. This generalizes the classical notion of a semiadditive (infinity) category. Intuitively, m-semiadditive infinity categories are those in which limits and colimits of diagrams indexed by m-finite spaces (that is, m-finite infinity groupoids) are canonically equivalent. Yonatan Harpaz proves a universal property of the infinity category of spans of n-finite spaces with m-truncated wrong way maps. This is used to establish an equivalent characterization of m-semiadditivity in terms of a well behaved, essentially unique action of this category of spans. This has the advantage of not only providing a more succinct method of detecting m-semiadditivity, but also providing a versatile structure to work with m-semiadditive infinity categories. In this thesis, we survey this sequence of results.},
