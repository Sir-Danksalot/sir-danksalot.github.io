**I am currently looking for postdocs for next year! If you think I might be relevant for a position of yours, please reach out!**

### Hello World!

I am a doctoral student at the [Universität Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/), working in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/mathematik/index.html.en).
I am generally interested in category theory and its applications, and I currently work in categorical probability under the guidance of [Tobias Fritz](http://tobiasfritz.science/).
I am also interested in other work with categorical themes, such as probabilistic programming, denotational semantics and type theory.

If that got your interest, you can find my current research statement [here]({%link assets/pdf/researchStatement.pdf %}).

Academics aside, I enjoy reading and listening to music or podcasts (particularly when I'm engaged in "grunt" work).

I completed a Master degree in Mathematics at the [Universität Regensburg](http://tobiasfritz.science/) under the supervision of [Denis-Charles Cisinski](https://cisinski.app.uni-regensburg.de/).
I earned my Bachelors degree from the [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).
