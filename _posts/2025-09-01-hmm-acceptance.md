Well, the [preprint]({% post_url 2024-01-26-hmm-preprint %}) we[^1] wrapped up last year on hidden Markov models and Bayesian filtering is finally published {%cite fritz2025HiddenMarkovModels %}.

It's been a long time coming, but I guess that's just how it goes sometimes.
It's more or less the same as the arXiv version, but the arXiv version isn't in the journal format (it also seems to have processed the string diagrams differently).
That said, at least my name shows up right this time :D

I've made sure my name is "Shah Mohammed" in all the later arXiv preprints, but that seems to have come at the cost of my first name being parsed as "Areeb Shah".
Should probably figure out how to fix that :/
