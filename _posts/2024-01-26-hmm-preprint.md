We[^1] have finally finished up a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14669) {%cite fritz2024hidden %} for our work on hidden Markov models[^2] in the context of Markov categories *(woohoo!)*.

We've been at it for a while, I'd in fact presented this work at the [Applied Category Theory 2023](https://act2023.github.io/) conference[^3] back in the August of 2023.
Of course, we've added a fair bit since then. For instance, the material on smoothing was all written after the conference. Still, it's good to finally have something out :D
