Writing this on the way back from the [Applied Category Theory](https://gataslab.org/act2025/act2025) conference at the University of Florida.

All in all, I had a great time! The organizers did a great job, and there were loads of really interesting talks. I also got to meet a bunch of people working on cool stuff, and had a ton of great conversations. Guess that means a bunch of stuff to look up now that it's over.

I also got to present some recent work on "partializations" of Markov categories {% cite shahmohammed2025PartializationsMarkovCategories %},[^1] companion to {% cite fritz2025lln %}. It went good overall, even if a bit rushed due to the 30 minute time constraint.
Good news is that people seemed to like it, and I got a fair number of questions and discussions after.

I will be heading to the [International Category Theory](https://conference.math.muni.cz/ct2025/) conference in Brno next month, and hope to see some familiar faces there. Looking forward to it!
