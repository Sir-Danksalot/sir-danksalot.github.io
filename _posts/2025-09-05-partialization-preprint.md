The (long) promised companion work to our[^1] earlier preprint {% cite fritz2025lln %} on empirical measures and laws of large numbers is finally out {% cite shahmohammed2025PartializationsMarkovCategories %}!

What originally started as a small section in that paper setting up a framework for the approach of that paper ended up growing into a fair bit of work in its own right.
And while the main results needed for {% cite fritz2025lln %} were done more or less by the end of last year, I just ended up figuring out more and more interesting things.
That only grew further as I kept discussing it with colleagues and friends, which is perhaps why it took longer than I initially expected.
Needless to say there's a lot more to explore in this direction, but it's gotten quite long already, and I wanted to get it out since {% cite fritz2025lln %} refers to it quite often.
Still, thats something to get to now!

I'd already presented it at the [ACT]({% post_url 2025-06-07-act-talk %}) and [CT25]({% post_url 2025-07-17-ct-talk %}) conferences earlier this year, and gotten some encouraging feedback.
So hopefully it'll get some reads :D
