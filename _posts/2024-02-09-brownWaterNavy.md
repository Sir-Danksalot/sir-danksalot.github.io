I recently happened to read [_The Rise and Fall of a Brown Water Navy: Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre and Maratha Seapower on the Arabian Sea in the 17th and 18th Centuries_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62990195-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-brown-water-navy), written by Anirudh Deshpande and Muphid Mujawar.
I've written more about it [here]({%link _books/2024-02-09-the_rise_and_fall_of_a_brown_water_navy.md %}), but the TL;DR is pretty good, would recommend.
