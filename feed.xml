Needless to say there’s a lot more to explore in this direction, but it’s gotten quite long already, and I wanted to get it out since <a class="citation" href="#fritz2025lln">(Fritz et al., 2025)</a> refers to it quite often.

It was great meeting so many people I’d only interacted with online (looks like there’s a fairly recurrent “CT crowd”). There were loads of intersting talks, and it was great to get an idea on what kind of stuff people are working on. And as always, its always fun to hang out.</p> <p>Brno was a really nice city, and apart from the super cool conference events we were lucky enough to have some locals show us around. The organizers did a great job, they managed to book the MU community centre/hall, which had a great setup (and managed to fit the rather large attendance rather comfortably). It also had a coffee shop right outside, which was a nice touch.</p> <p>I presented my recent work on “partializations” of Markov categories <a class="citation" href="#shahmohammed2025PartializationsMarkovCategories">(Shah Mohammed, 2025)</a> again,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> finally fulfilling <a class="citation" href="#fritz2025lln">(Fritz et al., 2025)</a>’s promise. Luckily the audience was more or less disjoint from the <a href="/blog/2025/act-talk/">ACT one</a>. It went good overall, and I guess I’d gotten better with the 30 minute time constraint the second time around. It was a split time slot this time. I ended up sharing a slot with talks on categorical logic and type theory, which are big CT areas of interest. Frankly I was a bit suprised I got as many attendees as I did, since categorical probability doesn’t seem to be too big a topic of interest for this conference. So no complaints there. I did get into some questions and discussions after as well, which was pretty nice.</p> <p>Overall, a great conference, and I’m looking forward to the next one.</p> <hr/> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Preprint’s almost done, I promise. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="talks"/><category term="math"/><category term="talk"/><category term="conference"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[International Category Theory 2025]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Conference and Talk</title><link href="www.areebsm.in/blog/2025/act-talk/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Conference and Talk"/><published>2025-06-04T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-04T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>www.areebsm.in/blog/2025/act-talk</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.areebsm.in/blog/2025/act-talk/"><![CDATA[<p>Writing this on the way back from the <a href="https://gataslab.org/act2025/act2025">Applied Category Theory</a> conference at the University of Florida.</p> <p>All in all, I had a great time!
